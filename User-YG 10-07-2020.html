<P style="font-size:35px;">i couldn't even think of a way to respond so i just tried to ignore them. i kept pouring my energy into things i couldn't handle, throwing myself out in the open in hopes that maybe something good would happen.<br><br> like someone who keeps gambling because there was no way they could lose more than they have already <img src="sad.gif" style="height:10%;float:right;margin-right:400px;">
<br><br>even when i take a step back for myself, i feel unsatisfied as if i've still lost. why didn't we do anything? nobody said a word <img src="angel.gif" style="height:10%;float:right;margin-right:700px;margin-top:70px;"></P>
