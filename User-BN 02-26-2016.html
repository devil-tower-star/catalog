<P style="text-align:left; padding: 20px; margin-top:-30px;">I went down to the water today. Nothing better after a long day of driving than to sit down and look at the sky and just breathe. Be in the moment. The water wasn’t clear and blue like one’d imagine when picturing the sea, rather it was swampy almost- muddy and surrounded by stones and reeds. 
<br>
Three-hundred feet or so away from the shore, there’s a large trench which water keeps spilling into. Nobody knows why it’s there or if there’s a bottom, large chunks of driftwood tend to crash onto the shore and drag people into the water so it’s unsafe to swim nearby. But there are always rumors about things like these in town; some say there’s a statue, some say a reflection of yourself, and some just say there’s trash. Nobody knows, or not that I know of.
<br>
I do want to take the time to describe the encounter I had with someone in 2013, on the 15th of December. They were dressed in a light orange jacket and were sitting on a bench on a cliff overlooking the whole beach, holding a pair of binoculars. I asked them what they were doing, and they responded by pointing to the sandier section of the beach and said that a few days ago, they had spotted what they thought to be a manifestation of pure evil, an eater of worlds. Lying right there, on the beach! Just a few days ago! It was a huge pile of flesh, repeatedly folding over itself, sprouting eyes that quickly withdrew into the skin.
<br>
“I could smell the stink from here,” They recalled.
<br>
 Of course, at the time I found this absurd, so I politely nodded, and we parted ways.
<br>
That night I dreamt I was on the shore again, pushing past the tall grass and walking towards the sea.<br>
It was perfectly clear. <br>
The moment I waded into the water, the sea exploded. The waves grew bigger and choppier. Logs were being thrown back and forth by the turbulent current. Throughout this, the water remained crystal clear but the waves easily blocked my vision. So I kept pushing further away from shore. After what felt like an eternity of struggling, there was a increasingly powerful repelling force radiating from the water and by this point I was breathing very hard so all I could do now was try and see. Surely enough, there was something in the hole, a dark shape darting and rising out and through the water and the spit and the foam and the heavy breaths, I could see a cascade of eyes opening and shutting and receding and sprouting and they all locked onto me.<br><br>
I felt something crash into the back of my head. I woke up in my bed at home, twenty miles away from the beach. I got up and poured myself a glass of orange juice.<br>
