(You are sitting at an office desk. You are drinking coffee. This morning the barista was a sullen teenager who constantly turned to look at his friends, who were sitting at the nearest table and cheering him on at his new job. You placed a particularly embarrassing order, and the sullen teenager was sure to joke about you to all his friends the moment he went on break. The day so far has been extremely mundane.)<br>
(You are sitting at an office desk, watching old music videos. Your boss stops by, and you assure him that you are on top of your work and chat with him about football (which you know nothing about but he is your boss so actually you are a big fan!) He laughs and walks away.)<br><br>
Act two. Setting is nighttime. Theme is friendship<br>

This is my once-in-a-lifetime chance to set things right, propel my career into motion! I have waited all my life to make something as brilliant as this, create something so important and meaningful that people would finally see me for the artist and director I am, you cannot mess this up for me. I have worked way too hard, I don’t understand why I’m still a failure. We have time for one more take, let’s try that again with less of the.. shittiness. Goddammit.
