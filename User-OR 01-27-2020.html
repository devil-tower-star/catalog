<P style="font-size:20px; margin-right:650px;">I have done my best to keep backups of journals and archive things where I could, but the mysterious disappearance of memories has not gone away. Watching the website that I've poured years of energy into vanish almost right before my eyes has been.. stressful to say the least. After a long period of observation, these are some things I have gathered about the phenomenon: <br>
	<br>1. There's some sort of hidden force at work here, I know that at the very least. It feeds on memories, making this catalog a perfect place to tether to<br>
	2. I can hardly remember the things it takes. I don't think anyone can. there are HUGE amounts of information missing from the catalog, I remember checking the logs last year and links within the code turning	 up empty<br>
	3. Everyone seems to know it's here? or feel that something is off, at least. but I guess nobody has really tried to explain it because nobody knows what to do about it.<br>
	4. It can take on many different forms depending on the users? I'm unsure about this one. Like, I have never been affected by this creature or whatever outside of the website. All I notice is missing code and journals, that's it.<br>
	5. Five
