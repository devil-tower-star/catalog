I could not believe my misfortune. I would have gotten my fortune told by the lady who runs the tarot shop like I do every week, but she’s been missing for a while. Oh, I could not believe my bad luck. If only I had known that I was unlucky this week, I wouldn’t have bought this lotto ticket and stapled it to my suitcase. Oh.. I could not believe the terrible fate that had overcome me.<br>
I was at the office today, finishing up for the day when I realized that new folders were created on my computer. Upon closer inspection I realized they weren't new folders but my old ones that had been emptied out. Alas, if only I could have forseen this tragic turn of events and done something to prevent it, but I was simply too unlucky.<br>
I went to the mall in the evening to get pretzels with a friend. Tomorrow I was leaving for another city so this was going to be the final time I would be able to spend time with them. While waiting and timidly chewing my soft pretzel rolls (some were dipped in cheese), I received a call from said friend, saying that they had come down with the most intense case of diarrhea they've ever experienced and could not come to meet me.<br>
"What an awful turn of events," I thought while eating the pretzel rolls I had saved for them.<br><br>
The other night, a brief but profound image flashed through my mind suddenly. I began to wonder what my life would look like if I could singlehandedly prevent all the tragedies that ever happened in the world. But if I changed one thing, another thing that I maybe liked would probably change too, so if I had the power to change only the things I didn't like and somehow keep the rest the same, maybe that would be good.
