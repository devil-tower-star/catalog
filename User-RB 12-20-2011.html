<P style = "color:lightyellow; font-size:18px;">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Jesus christ, I remember having to constantly throw up when I went to meet her, I rented a room at a hotel for a month and I just couldn't keep the food down. at first I chalked it up to just another physical illness, but looking back I realize that it stemmed from the sheer terror I felt then. Like seeing her for the first time and realizing that something very awful would happen soon. that kind of terror 
<br><br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In retrospect, it was kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think I did really cruel things because I didn't like the person I was back then. They say anything can be forgotten with time but goddamn, it's going to be hard.</P>
