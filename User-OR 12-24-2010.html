<P style="font-size:20px; margin-right:700px;">Happy holidays! This site is so big now, I'm astounded :) Maybe we should throw a party somehow, I know there's a way to share movies and we could set up a chatroom for hanging out to celebrate lol! Let me know :)<br><br>This year I drove up to a ski lodge and stayed there for a week. I stayed at a house I rented out from a family friend. There was snow EVERYWHERE and the scenery was completely blue at the bottom of the mountain. I had been there the year before too, but I had been struggling with depression back then so coming back and experiencing it in a new light was great. Like.. I went up to the top of the mountain and looking over everything and seeing the endless sky around you.. that probably added 10 years to my life. Skiing is probably one of my favorite sports now. Aside from the packing and suiting up, god.</P>
