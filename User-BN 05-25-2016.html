<P style="text-align:left; padding:20px; margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:-30px;">Every year I swear to disown my relatives but I never do it. My mother still calls, even after I've grown up and moved away, to talk about stupid shit (the following):
</P>
<br>
<ol>
<li>My Weight</li>
<li>Personal Trainers</li>
<li>Trips With Her Lady Friends to Faraway Mountains</li>
</ol>

<P style="text-align:left; padding:20px; margin-top:-30px;">
I think she's sick in the head, even more so than me, and sometimes I feel sorry for her. But mostly I ignore it until I forget to ignore it and then I hear the same shit all over again.
Sometimes it's too much to bear and I get so frustrated I can't move, like my entire body is sour with anger. <br><br>
"What if she's right?" This is a question that I pose to myself on my worst days. And then I remember it literally does not matter to me. <br><hr style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;"><br>

I wrote this during another heated and just overall terrible argument with my mom, but I've calmed down a bit now. Co-workers I've chatted with about it have suggested that I should maybe humor her somewhat but I think that would just end up pissing both of us off. I don't have the time for this, I have cake and booze to tear through.
