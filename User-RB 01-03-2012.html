<P style="font-size:18px;">I just can't shake the feeling that there's still something important to do. Like when you forget to meet someone and they were left waiting in the rain, that kind of feeling. God, what a cliche but it's true. That's why diseases like dementia are so awful, they take away your memories and you KNOW something is missing but the mental snow prevents you from piecing it together.There's something watching and waiting for me to slip up. <br><br><br>Spent all of last month asking for references in hopes of finding a gig elsewhere. I managed to find a job on the east coast and I'm going to board a flight to New York tomorrow. No need to pack, the things I need were already in front of me from the start. You just needed to reach out and grab ahold of them.  It's weird that running away is so easy but I'm ready for a fresh start, for real this time. It's a new year, new me.</P>
